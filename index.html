    <section id="about" class="container section-content">
        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a pre-medical student at the University of California, San Diego, currently pursuing a B.S. in Human
            Biology. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in the biological sciences, which I've
            complemented with extensive hands-on clinical experience and involvement in research. As a certified EMT,
            I've provided direct patient care in fast-paced environments and gained firsthand insight into the urgency,
            empathy, and critical thinking required in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond clinical work, I am passionate about education and service. I've taught life-saving skills like CPR
            to both healthcare providers and community members, mentored future EMTs, and led training initiatives as
            part of UC San Diego's Emergency Medical Services club. My role as a Resident Assistant has deepened my
            ability to lead with empathy, resolve conflicts, and build supportive communities. These are skills I
            consider essential to any future physician.
        </p>
        <p>
            Above all, I am committed to advancing health equity and serving underserved populations. I believe that
            effective medical care begins with compassion, and I strive to bring curiosity, integrity, and purpose to
            every experience I take on. I look forward to a future in medicine where I can combine my clinical skills
            and social values to make a lasting impact on individual lives and community health.
